## About

**Vermon** monitors the version of the package specified on the [`pypi`](https://pypi.org/) platform, compares the version of the package installed in your environment with the latest published version and, if less, shows a warning with instructions for updating in the terminal.

***For example:*** *suppose you created a package called `foo` and published version `1.0.0` in pypi. Some users are already using the foo package as a dependency on their projects. You found a bug and released a patch with the fix, now the latest version of `foo` is `1.0.1`. All users using version `1.0.0` (less than the last release) of the package will receive a warning on the terminal similar to this one whenever they run the project:*

```bash
> python user_project.py
You are using an old version of the foo package (v1.0.0)
a new version has been released (v1.0.1).
Please run: python -m pip install foo --upgrade
```

Now users know they have a dependency that needs to be updated ;)


## Install

Use [`pipenv`](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) to install fordev in your environment. It will create a virtual environment and separate all dependencies and subdependencies from your global environment.

### Install with pipenv

Create a directory and enter it:

```bash
$ mkdir my_project && cd my_project
```

Install with pipenv using:

```bash
$ pipenv install vermon
```

Now activate the virtual environment:

```bash
$ pipenv shell
```

### Install with pip and virtualenv

Alternatively, if you don't want to use pipenv, use `pip` + `virtualenv` to do the same thing.

Create a directory and enter it:

```bash
$ mkdir my_project && cd my_project
```

Create and activate the virtual environment:

```bash
$ virtualenv venv && source venv/Scripts/activate
```
> Note: In linux environment, use `source venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment.

Now install with pip:

```bash
$ pip install vermon
```

Done, now you can start the job ;)
